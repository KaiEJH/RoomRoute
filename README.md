# Developer Set-Up
## Node.JS
This install guide will make use of NVM which is a version manager for Node, that lets you easily change between the version you are using.
## GIT
GIT is used for version control but more importantly for us, code sharing. It allows multiple people to work on the same project and easily update code between different devices.
Get GIT [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win). _(You can use default settings, but I recommend changing default editor to VSCode.)_

### Setting Up GIT with your GitHub Account
You can use whatever name you want associated with changes by using this command in the command prompt.
```
git config --global user.name "username you want here. keep it professional"
```
To bind it with your GitHub account, use the following command either with the email you used for GitHub signup, or if you have email privacy enabled, the one provided in your GitHub account under emails and primary email.
```
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

## VSCode
We recommend that you use VSCode as your editor as it has good GIT integration and pretty intuitive buttons for pushing and pulling updates from the repository.
### Set Up
Get VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). _(You can just use the default settings.)_
